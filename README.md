# Image Classification
### Flower Recognition - Performance Evaluation on CNN 
Trained the system for Flower Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network. A performance evaluation was done on the architecture design. First trained the system with only one hidden layer. Then trained on two hidden layers. The accuracy graph is shown below.

### Database
The dataset for Flower Recognition was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition). 

	Image Size = 320X240
	Total Images: 4242
	Number of Classes: 5

#### Class Labels:
	* chamomile 
	* tulip 
	* rose
	* sunflower 
	* dandelion

### Implementation
* Python 3.6.2
* Numpy
* TFLearn
