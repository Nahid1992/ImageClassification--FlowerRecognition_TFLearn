# Image Classification
### Flower Recognition - Performance Evaluation on CNN 
Trained the system for Flower Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network. A performance evaluation was done on the architecture design. First trained the system with only one hidden layer. Then trained on two hidden layers. The accuracy graph is shown below.

### Database
The dataset for Flower Recognition was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition). 

	Image Size = 320X240
